### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Henry. I'm a full-time back-end engineer for AWS's Builder Tools during the day while also moonlighting as a
full-stack engineer for my wife's nail salon (e.g. https://www.heranails.salon, https://intranet.heranailsnspa.com) and
for my own hobbies (e.g. https://nguyen.gg, https://henry.reviews).

I'm a Java expert by trade, Golang enthusiast by passion, and actively looking to add Rust to my long list of
proficiencies which includes but is not limited to:

- Core AWS services (the websites above are run using React Server-side Rendering on AWS Lambda, fronted by CloudFront,
  using DynamoDB and S3 as primary datastore).
- JavaScript/TypeScript and front-end libraries and frameworks like React, Next.js, etc.
- [Java Swing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_(Java)) for heavy GUI needs.
- [Tkinter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tkinter) for light GUI needs.
- Learning Qt and its bindings in spare time.
