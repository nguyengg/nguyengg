### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Henry. I'm a full-time back-end engineer for AWS's Builder Tools during the day while also moonlighting as a
full-stack engineer for my wife's nail salon (e.g. https://www.heranails.salon, https://intranet.heranailsnspa.com) and
for my own hobbies (e.g. https://nguyen.gg, https://henry.reviews).

I'm a Golang enthusiast by passion, Java expert by trade, and actively looking to add Rust to my long list of
proficiencies.
